    <h1>Polymath</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>A <strong>polymath</strong> (Greek: πολυμαθής, romanized: <em>polymathēs</em>, lit. 'having learned much'; Latin: <em>homo universalis</em>, lit. 'universal human')[1] is an individual whose knowledge spans a substantial number of subjects, known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems.</p>

    <p>In Western Europe, the first work to use the term <strong>polymathy</strong> in its title (<em>De Polymathia tractatio: integri operis de studiis veterum</em>) was published in 1603 by Johann von Wowern, a Hamburg philosopher.[2][3][4] Von Wowern defined polymathy as "knowledge of various matters, drawn from all kinds of studies ... ranging freely through all the fields of the disciplines, as far as the human mind, with unwearied industry, is able to pursue them".[2] Von Wowern lists erudition, literature, philology, philomathy, and polyhistory as synonyms.</p>

    <p>The earliest recorded use of the term in the English language is from 1624, in the second edition of <em>The Anatomy of Melancholy</em> by Robert Burton;[5] the form <em>polymathist</em> is slightly older, first appearing in the <em>Diatribae upon the first part of the late History of Tithes</em> of Richard Montagu in 1621.[6] Use in English of the similar term <em>polyhistor</em> dates from the late 16th century.[7]</p>
